Question 4.1

Compare the output from your function and the result you obtain by using pencil-and-paper derivation. How is the function differs from the approach we use in pencil-and-paper derivation?

Answer:

The implemented function checking the entailment indirectly prooves a statement by evaluating a subsidiary theorem. In contrast, checking entailment by hand usually involves deriving and comparing two solution sets with each other.



Question 4.2.2

Check your answer about what B and C are with the answer from pencil-and-paper derivation in exercise. Can you decide what A is? Is it true that if KB |= α, then it must be that KB |= ¬ α? Explain your answers.

Answer:

The answer about what B and C are conincides with the pencil-and-paper derivation.
The nature of A cannot be deduced in this problem, because the knowledge base includes both interpretations for A. Therefore the KB neither entails "knight" nor "knave". 
On the other hand, the given information is sufficient to deduce the nature of B as "knave" and C as "knight", because the KB only includes distinct solutions.
In general, if a KB doesn't entail a sentence, it is not possible to infer that it entails the negated sentence. Entailment only comprises distinct solutions.
